# Bonsai Solidity Contracts

This directory contains the Solidity contract for deploying a [Bonsai] application through the Ethereum relay. 
There are two primary starter template contracts included.

The Solidity libraries for Bonsai can be found at [github.com/risc0/risc0](https://github.com/risc0/risc0/tree/main/bonsai/ethereum).

Contracts are built and tested with [forge], which is part of the [Foundry] toolkit.
Tests are defined in the `tests` directory.
