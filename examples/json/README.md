# JSON Example

This code demonstrates how to prove that a JSON file contains a specific field and value using the RISC Zero zkVM. The JSON file is identified by SHA-256 hash, allowing users to commit to a specific JSON file and then prove some of its contents without revealing the full file.

## Quick Start

First, follow the [examples guide] to install dependencies and check out the correct version of the example.

Then, run the example with:

```bash
cargo run --release
```
