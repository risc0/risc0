# SHA Example

This code demonstrates how to provably compute the SHA-256 hash of a string using RISC Zero.

## Performance

While the SHA-256 implementation in the zkVM is optimized using hardware acceleration, generating zero-knowledge proofs still requires computational resources. For faster development and testing, we recommend running this example on [Bonsai] or using the [`DEV_MODE`][DEV_MODE].

## Quick Start

First, follow the [examples guide] to install dependencies and check out the correct version of the example.

Then, run the example with:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

Or in [`DEV_MODE`][DEV_MODE] for much faster execution:

```bash
RISC0_DEV_MODE=1 cargo run --release
```

Notable details:

- We show two ways of calling the hash function:
  - Using `risc0_zkvm::sha`, which is the SHA-256 interface included in the `risc0_zkvm` crate.
  - Using a patched version of the [RustCrypto] `sha2` crate. Including this patch will accelerate _all_ usages of SHA-256 that use the `sha2` crate in any transitive dependency.
  - Either approach will use the RISC Zero SHA-256 accelerator in the zkVM guest, which has _much_ higher performance than any software implementation.
- We could have passed the guest a `String` rather than a string literal for the same result.
- Interpreting the output on the host side as a `risc0_zkp::core::sha::Digest` is useful for quality of life. We could also directly read the bytes written in the journal, but then we need to be careful about endianness, printing the bytes (`Digest` implements the `Display` trait), etc.
