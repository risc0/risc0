# Groth16 Verifier Example

This **experimental** example demonstrates the verification of a proof from another proof system, in this case Groth16 over the BN_254 curve, within the zkVM.

## Summary
This example uses a pre-generated `Groth16 proof` of a Sudoku solution generated via [zkSudoku].  You can also try with an [ECDSA-circuit] example created by [0xPARC] or any other Circom project.

Specifically, you will learn:
- How to verify a Groth16 proof generated by Circom/SnarkJS. To learn how to generate such a proof, follow the [zkSudoku] README or the Circom [tutorial].
- How to prove the verification of a Groth16 proof in the zkVM.

## Performance
This example requires ~500M cycles to run and therefore will take some time to prove locally. We recommend running it on [Bonsai] or just running in [DEV_MODE].

## Quick Start

First, follow the [installation guide] if you don't already have the RISC Zero tools installed.

Then, run the example in [DEV_MODE] with:
```bash
RISC0_DEV_MODE=1 cargo run --release
```
