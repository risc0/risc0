//! The RISC Zero zkVM's guest-side RISC-V API.
//!
//! Code that is validated by the [RISC Zero zkVM](crate) is run inside the guest. In almost all
//! practical cases, the guest will want to read private input data from the host and write public
//! data to the journal. This can be done with [env::read] and [env::commit], respectively;
//! additional I/O functionality is also available in [mod@env].
//!
//! ## Installation
//!
//! To build and run RISC Zero zkVM code, you will need to install the RISC Zero
//! toolchain, which can be done using the rzup utility:
//!
//! ```sh
//! curl -L https://risczero.com/install | bash
//! rzup install
//! ```
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! The following guest code[^starter-ex] proves a number is
//! composite by multiplying two unsigned integers, and panicking if either is
//! `1` or if the multiplication overflows:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #![no_main]
//! #![no_std]
//!
//! use risc0_zkvm::guest::env;
//!
//! risc0_zkvm::guest::entry!(main);
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     // Load the first number from the host
//!     let a: u64 = env::read();
//!     // Load the second number from the host
//!     let b: u64 = env::read();
//!     // Verify that neither of them are 1 (i.e. nontrivial factors)
//!     if a == 1 || b == 1 {
//!         panic!("Trivial factors")
//!     }
//!     // Compute the product while being careful with integer overflow
//!     let product = a.checked_mul(b).expect("Integer overflow");
//!     env::commit(&product);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Notice how [env::read] is used to load the two factors, and [env::commit] is used to make their
//! composite product publicly available. All inputs and outputs of your guest are private except for
//! what is written to the journal with [env::commit].
//!
//! By default, the guest only has the Rust `core` libraries and not `std`. A partial
//! implementation of the Rust standard libraries can be enabled with the `std` feature on this [crate].
//! When this feature is not enabled, the lines including `#![no_std]` and `#![no_main]` are
//! required, as well as the use of the [crate::guest::entry] macro. When `std` is enabled, these
//! three lines can be omitted and many features of `std` can be used.
//!
//! If you encounter problems building zkVM guest code, you can see if we have a
//! known workaround for your issue by looking in our
//! [rust guest workarounds](https://github.com/risc0/risc0/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22rust+guest+workarounds%22)
//! tag on GitHub.
//!
//! [^starter-ex]: The example is based on the [Factors example](https://github.com/risc0/risc0/tree/main/examples/factors).
