//! Prover implementation for the recursion VM.

//! This module contains the recursion programs used with the zkVM.
//! As examples, the [lift], [join], and [resolve] programs are used
//! oto compress a collection of STARK receipts for a composition into
//! a single succinct receipt.

// of SuccinctReceipt, but is logically part of the recursion system.
