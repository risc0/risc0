//! Proof of Verifiable Work (PoVW) implementation.
//!
//! This crate provides Merkle tree-based data structures for tracking and proving work
//! completed during ZK proof generation. The main components include:
//!
//! - [`WorkSet`]: Top-level container for multiple work logs
//! - [`WorkLog`]: Collection of jobs within a single prover's work log
//! - [`Job`]: Representation of a range of used nonces in a job (i.e. a single continuation)
//! - [`Bitmap`]: 256-bit bitmap for efficient nonce tracking
//!
//! The implementation uses Merkle trees to enable efficient proofs of inclusion and
//! non-inclusion for nonces, supporting the PoVW system's requirement to prevent
//! double-counting of work.
