/// A PolyGroup represents a group of polynomials, all of the same maximum
/// degree, as well as the evaluation of those polynomials over some domain that
/// is larger than that degree by some invRate. Additionally, it includes a
/// dense Merkle tree, where each entry is a single point of the domain, and the
/// leaf hash is a simple linear hash of all of the values at that point.  That
/// is, if we have 100 polynomials evaluated on 2^16 points, the merkle tree has
/// 2^16 entries, each being a hash of 100 values.  The size of the domain is
/// always a power of 2 so that we can use NTTs.
///
/// The primary purpose of the PolyGroup is for use in the DEEP-ALI protocol,
/// which basically needs 4 methods during proof generation, specifically we
/// need to: 1) Resolve queries (i.e. make MerkleColProofs)
/// 2) Do evaluation of the polynomials at 'randomly' chosen points
/// 3) Mix the polynomials via a random set of linear coefficients
/// 4) Access the raw values in the evaluation domain to 'evaluate' the
///    constraint polynomial
///
/// The poly group holds 3 buffers:
/// 1) The per-polynomial coefficients, used for evaluation + mixing
/// 2) The points evaluated on the domain in question (for the 'col' part of
///    merkle proofs)
/// 3) The Merkle tree itself.
///
/// PolyGroups are constructed from two basic sources: steps of a computations,
/// and a single higher degree polynomial that has been split into lower degree
/// parts.  In the case of computations, the resulting steps must be padded
/// (possibly with randomized data), which is presumed to be done by the caller.
/// The constructor additionally 'shifts' the polynomial so that f(x) -> f(3*x),
/// which means that the normal NTT evaluation domain does not reveal anything
/// about the original datapoints (i.e. is zero knowledge) so long as there is
/// sufficient randomized padding.
