In order for the proof of [[Haböck](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1216.pdf), Theorem 8] to go through, we need to apply FRI with proximity parameter $\\theta < 1 - \\sqrt{\\rho^+}$ (note the +!). In particular, we can't choose `m` _too_ large, or else $\\theta := 1 - \\sqrt{\\rho} \\cdot \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot m} \\right)$ will become larger than $1 - \\sqrt{\\rho^+}$, and the key step in that theorem will fail. Specifically, the relevant _configuration's_ distance from Reed–Solomon code $\\mathsf{RS}_{k^+}(K, D)$ over the function field $K := F(Z)$ will exceed the Johnson bound of that code. For our parameters, this doesn't happen until `m = 131073`, so we have plenty of room.\n",

Indeed, with these parameters, we have $\\log_2 \\left( \\epsilon_{\\text{FRI-queries}} \\right) = s \\cdot \\log_2 \\left( \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot m} \\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\geq -s$, where the latter holds even in the limit as $m \\rightarrow \\infty$. Paradoxically, the larger proximity parameters Conjecture 8.4 makes possible—i.e., in the range $\\theta \\geq 1 - \\sqrt{\\rho}$—don't help us here, _unless_ we also make further conjectures about the list-decodability of Reed–Solomon codes up to capacity. Sure enough, the proof of [[Haböck](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1216.pdf), Theorem 8] relies on the list-decodability of the Reed–Solomon code $\\mathsf{RS}_{k^+}(K, D)$, where $K := F(Z)$ is the infinite function field over $F$ in one indeterminate. This latter list decodability will fail as soon as $\\theta \\geq 1 - \\sqrt{\\rho^+}$.\n",

As a digression, we note that this conjecture seems highly unlikely to be proven soon; in fact, our best-known explicit constructions of capacity-achieving codes are far more complicated than standard Reed–Solomon codes; we refer example to [[Guruswami](https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/TCS-007)].\n",

To that end, this section adapts the analysis above to reflect provable soundness in the unique decoding radius. We worked with Al Kindi (Polygon) in order to translate Theorem 8.3 from the [Proximity Gaps] paper into a corresponding result for the unique-decoding radius, finding e_FRI_constant = (D+1) * (L + folding_factor - 1) * num_fri_rounds / F_FRI. An informal version of this analysis is available [here](https://hackmd.io/@pgaf/HkKs_1ytT). A more formal (unpublished) analysis is available upon request. It remains to integrate this analysis into the context of Theorem 8 from [Summary on the FRI Low-Degree Test]. This remaining work is reflected in the TODOs in the calculator.*"
