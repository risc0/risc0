# Introduction

Welcome to the [RISC Zero][external-risc-zero] documentation!

RISC Zero is creating the infrastructure & tooling necessary for
developers around the globe to build software that leverages **verifiable computation**. With verifiable computation, you can be cryptographically confident that a specific blob of data was produced by a specific algorithm.

This technology is poised to enable the finance and healthcare sectors to prove compliance while maintaining privacy, and enables the tech sector to address decades-long trust gaps in software supply chains.

Historically,
the only method for confirming the correct execution of a software application
was through redundant computation. ZK introduces a new option: **verifiable
computation**.

It's now possible to pair a program's output with a self-certifying _receipt_,
allowing a skeptical third party to verify correct execution — and the verifier
doesn't need to repeat the original computation or even see the inputs to the
program!
