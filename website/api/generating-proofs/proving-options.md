# Options for Proof Generation

To support a variety of use cases, RISC Zero allows users a variety of options for proof generation.

Users can choose between:

1. [dev-mode]: No proofs are generated, enabling rapid prototyping.
2. [Local Proving]: Proofs are generated on the user's own hardware.
3. [Remote Proving]: Proofs are generated by [Boundless], an open-market for R0VM users.

We recommend option 1 during development, option 2 for applications involving private inputs, and option 3 for all other applications.

:::tip
[`prove_with_opts`] allows users to choose between [composite, succinct or groth16 receipts].
See the [Shrink-Wrapping] page for more details about groth16 receipts.
