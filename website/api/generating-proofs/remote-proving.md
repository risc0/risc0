# Remote Proving

Boundless is a decentralized proving marketplace which lets users generate proofs for their [R0VM applications][docs-zkVM], without using their own hardware for proof generation. At a high level, users request proofs to the Boundless protocol and permissionless provers generate proofs on behalf of the user. In each proof request, users specify which zkVM application they want to run, as well as inputs to that program, and Boundless returns a proof.

Boundless is highly decentralized, offering high reliability and reducing the impact of any single entity on proof generation and delivery. To get a taste of what you can do with Boundless, check out the [Boundless Docs][external-boundless-docs], specifically the [Quick Start][external-boundless-quick-start] and the [Request a Proof Tutorial][external-boundless-request-tutorial].
