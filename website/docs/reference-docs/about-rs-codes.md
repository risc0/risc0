# About Reed Solomon Codes

[Reed Solomon codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reedâ€“Solomon_error_correction) (RS codes) are a family of [error correcting codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code) based on polynomials over [finite fields](about-finite-fields.md).

## Documentation

Implementation and documentation for Reed-Solomon encoding is in the `risc0-zkp-core` [Rust crate](https://docs.rs/risc0-zkp-core/latest/risc0_zkp_core/).

## Basic Function

A RISC Zero [receipt] demonstrates the validity of the associated [execution trace](../proof-system/what-is-a-trace.md) by encoding the execution instructions and the trace data into polynomials and then making various assertions about those polynomials.
We refer to this process as _arithmetization of the trace_, and RISC Zero's arithmetization is based on Reed Solomon encoding.

## Background

Adding a [parity bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_bit) to a binary string offers a form of error detection.
Error correcting codes extend this line of thinking: when sending data that may get corrupted, we can allow the recipient to detect and correct errors by adding some error correcting bits.
Reed-Solomon codes are an industry standard for error correction; they're used in many signal processing applications, including cell communication, QR codes, and [STARKs](about-starks.md).

In the context of RISC Zero's receipts, the relevance of Reed-Solomon codes is quite a bit more nuanced than the standard error correction use cases.
The error amplification of Reed-Solomon encoding provides cryptographic soundness to RISC Zero's computational receipts.
During the process of generating a receipt, any errors in the trace are _amplified_ by the process of arithmetization.
This error amplification means that even a single error in the execution trace can be easily identified.
