# About the FRI Protocol

The FRI ([**F**ast](about-ntts-and-fourier.md), [**R**eed-Solomon](about-rs-codes.md) [**I**nteractive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_proof_system) [Oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_machine) [Proof of Proximity](https://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/sites/g/files/omnuum6656/files/privacytools/files/stoc283fp-rothblum.pdf)) protocol is the final component of RISC Zero's argument of computational integrity.

RISC Zero's [STARK](about-starks.md) converts an assertion of computational integrity to an assertion about polynomial division.
In the language of Reed-Solomon codes, this assertion about polynomial division can be re-framed as an assertion about [block proximity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance).
The FRI protocol finishes the argument by proving the assertion about block proximity.

## Basic Function

Given a Merkle root, the _FRI protocol_ is a recursive technique for proving that the associated Merkle leaves are associated with a low-degree polynomial.

## Background

### Inside the Algorithm

The FRI protocol consists of a number of `commit` rounds followed by a number of `query` rounds.

- In each `commit` round, the Prover commits a new (smaller) Merkle tree corresponding to evaluations of a lower-degree polynomial; the round-by-round commitments depend on a random mixing parameter that allows for an audit-trail in the upcoming query round.
  - In each `commit` round, the degree of the FRI polynomial and the size of the associated Merkle tree is reduced by a factor of 16, in the RISC Zero implementation.
  - RISC Zero runs `commit` rounds until the degree of the FRI polynomial is less than or equal to 255.
- In each `query` round, the Prover reveals Merkle branches (and leaves) from each of the FRI commitments. The branches revealed in the query rounds are selected using the [Fiat-Shamir Heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat%E2%80%93Shamir_heuristic).
  - Varying the number of `query` rounds offers a tradeoff between security level and computational efficiency.

### About DEEP-FRI

Shortly after the FRI protocol was released, an alternative protocol called DEEP-FRI was released.
Although DEEP-FRI was initially thought to have improved soundness relative to FRI, the Proximity Gaps for Reed-Solomon Codes paper shows that the original FRI protocol offers the same soundness results as DEEP-FRI at less computational complexity.
The RISC Zero ZKP system uses the original FRI protocol.
