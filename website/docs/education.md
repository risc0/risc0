# RISC Zero Education Hub

Welcome to the RISC Zero Education Hub!

The materials here are intended to support learners of all backgrounds to make sense of the technology that underlies RISC Zero's tooling.

- Our **[conference talks and podcast appearances]** offer an overview of what we're building.
- Our **[blog]** highlights the key features and technical progress we've made.
- Our **[Study Club]** goes deeper into the tech, explaining the technological components that make our tooling possible.
- Our **[Education Database]** is a curated list of some of our favorite resources.

If there's a piece of our tech stack that you're struggling to make sense of, please [open an issue] to help us improve.
Or find us on [Discord] and ask us there!
