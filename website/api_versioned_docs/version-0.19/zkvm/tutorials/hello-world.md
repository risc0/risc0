# Building zkVM Hello World

This tutorial will walk you through building your first zkVM application.
By following the steps in this guide, you will learn how:

- to use the [cargo risczero] tool to create a new project
- to send private data to the guest program
- the zkVM executes and generates a proof of a guest program
- the guest writes public output

## Step 1: Create a new project

Firstly, visit the [installation] page for how to install all the necessary software.
Secondly, using the `cargo-risczero` tool create a `hello-world` project from the command line. The `cargo-risczero` tool allows for a `--guest-name` parameter, a guest program you want to run on zkVM to generate a proof of its execution:

```bash
## Create a project from our starter template
cd risc0/examples/hello-world
```

In the project folder, `hello-world`, build and run the project using `cargo run --release`.
Use this command any time you'd like to check your progress.

## Step 2 (Host): Share private data as input with the guest

zkVM or a [prover] runs on the **[host]**. The host code is in `hello-world/host/src/main.rs`.
The host creates an executor environment `ExecutorEnv` before constructing a prover.
The host makes the value `input` available to the guest before execution. It does it by adding `input` to the executor environment, which is responsible for managing guest-readable memory. When the prover executes the program, it can access input:

```rust
use risc0_zkvm::{default_prover, ExecutorEnv};

fn main() {
    let input: u32 = 7;
    let env = ExecutorEnv::builder().write(&input).unwrap().build().unwrap();
}
```

## Step 3 (Guest): Read input and commit output

Now, let's look at the guest code located in `methods/guest/src/main.rs`.
This is the portion of the code that will be proven.
In the code snippet below, the guest reads the `input` value from the host and then commits it to the [journal] portion of the [receipt].

```rust ignore
use risc0_zkvm::guest::env;

fn main() {
    // read the input
    let input: u32 = env::read();

    // do something with the input
    // write public output to the journal
    env::commit(&input);
}
```

The `env::commit` function commits public results to the [journal]. Once committed to the journal, anyone with the [receipt] can read this value.

Notice, by committing any private information to the journal, we make this private data public. We want to avoid committing sensitive data to public journal.

## Step 4 (Host): Generate a receipt and read its journal contents

Let's look at how the host generates a receipt and extracts the [journal]'s contents.
We get a receipt, extract a journal from the receipt, and verify it.
In a real-world scenario, we'd want to hand the [receipt] to someone else for verification, and the `prove` function does internal verification of the receipt.
After we extract journal from the receipt, let's print `Hello world` with the public output by adding this line to the host: `println!("Hello, world! I generated a proof of guest execution! {} is a public output from journal", _output);`

```rust ignore
use methods::{
    HELLO_GUEST_ELF, HELLO_GUEST_ID
};
use risc0_zkvm::{default_prover, ExecutorEnv};

fn main() {
    let input: u32 = 15 * u32::pow(2, 27) + 1;
    let env = ExecutorEnv::builder().write(&input).unwrap().build().unwrap();
    // Obtain the default prover.
    let prover = default_prover();
    // Produce a receipt by proving the specified ELF binary.
    let receipt = prover.prove_elf(env, HELLO_GUEST_ELF).unwrap();

    // Extract journal of receipt
    let _output: u32 = receipt.journal.decode().unwrap();

    // Print, notice, after committing to a journal, the private input became public
    println!("Hello, world! I generated a proof of guest execution! {} is a public output from journal ", _output);
}
```

You should now be able to see your proof with `cargo run --release`.
If your program printed the "Hello, world!" assertion and [receipt] verification was a success, congratulations!
If not, we hope that troubleshooting will get you familiar with the system, and we'd love to chat with you on [Discord].
