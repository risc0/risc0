# zkVM Overview

The RISC Zero zero-knowledge virtual machine [zkVM] (zkVM) lets you [prove]
correct execution of arbitrary Rust code. By allowing users to build
zero-knowledge applications that **leverage existing Rust packages**, the RISC
Zero zkVM makes it quick and easy to build powerful verifiable software
applications.

To learn more about what this enables, check out our [use cases] page.

If you're ready to start building, check out our [zkVM Quick Start][quickstart]
and our [zkVM example applications][examples].

## What are the components of a zkVM application?

The core of a zkVM application is the [guest program].
The guest program is the part of the application that gets proven.

To prove correct execution of the [guest program]:

1. The [guest program] is compiled to an [ELF binary]. <br />
2. The [executor] runs the [ELF binary] and records the [session].
3. The [prover] checks and proves the validity of the [session], outputting a
   [receipt].

> **Note:** You only need to worry about the details of step 2 & step 3 if
> you're running the zkVM on your own hardware. See [Host Code 101][host program] for more details on these steps. If you're using [Bonsai] for remote
> proving, you won't need to write host code.

Anyone with a copy of the [receipt] can [verify] the [guest program]'s execution
and read its [publicly shared outputs][journal]. The verification algorithm
receives an [ImageID] as a parameter; the ImageID serves as a cryptographic
identifier for the expected ELF binary.

## Deploying a zkVM Application

Once you've built a zkVM application, you can generate proofs on your own
machine(s) or you can make requests to [Bonsai] to generate proofs as needed.

For local proof generation, we recommend a machine with at least 16GB of RAM.
Options for generating proofs using GPU acceleration and skipping proof
generation are documented in the [feature flags].
