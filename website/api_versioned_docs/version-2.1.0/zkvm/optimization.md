# Guest Optimization Guide

RISC Zero's zkVM is designed and built to act like a physical CPU. We did this
so you could use general purpose languages (e.g. Rust) and general purpose tools
(e.g. Cargo, LLVM). **Generally, you can apply general purpose optimization
techniques too!**

In this guide, we'll cover optimization of [zkVM guest programs]. We'll discuss
when you can apply common techniques from other contexts, and when you need a
new approach.

## Background

### What Is the zkVM, Really?

**The zkVM is essentially a CPU.**

In particular, it is an implementation of the [RISC-V architecture]
(specifically riscv32im), similar to how your laptop's CPU may be an
implementation of an [x86] or [ARM] architecture. This biggest difference is
that the zkVM is implemented with [arithmetic circuits], in software, instead of
circuitry made from silicon and copper.

### What Is a "Cycle"?

Both in the zkVM and on physical CPUs, the cost of an operation is measured in
"clock cycles".

Intuitively, a "clock cycle" is the smallest unit of time in a CPU's operation,
representing one tick of the CPU's internal clock and the time it takes to
execute a basic CPU operation (e.g. adding two integers). We'll refer to this as
a "cycle".

**Proving times for the zkVM are directly related to the number of cycles in an
execution.**

## General Techniques and Advice

**Start by applying general techniques and best practices for optimizing your
code.**

[The Rust Performance Book][perf-book] is great resource. It's not very long, it
covers a range of topics important to performance, and gives applicable advice
for optimization. If you are new to optimization, or new to Rust, we recommend
you read this guide.

### Don't Assume, Measure.

Performance is complex, in the zkVM as on a physical CPU.
Don't assume you know what the bottlenecks are. Measure and experiment.

If you make a function 100x faster (or ∞x faster) but it only takes 1% of your
execution time, you'll see less than 1% improvement in performance. This is
generally referred to as [Amdahl's Law][amdhal], and practically it means you
shouldn't waste your time optimizing something that's not the taking a
significant portion of execution time.

### Measuring by Printing to Console

Starting simple, measure by adding an `eprintln!` line to your guest code to
measure how long an operation takes, and how many times it is called.

Using [`env::cycle_count()`] will tell you the current number of execution
cycles that have occurred in your program.

As an example:

{/* NOTE: Ignored since we do not yet have a way to test guest code in docs */}

```rust no_run title="methods/guest/src/main.rs"
# use risc0_zkvm::guest::env;
fn my_operation_to_measure() {
  let start = env::cycle_count();

  // potentially expensive or frequently called code
  // ...

  let end = env::cycle_count();
  eprintln!("my_operation_to_measure: {}", end - start);
}
```

When you run your guest, you'll see a printout of the cycle count each time that
function is called. You can then analyze this data easily with a tool like
[`counts`].

### Profiling

**Profiling is one of the most important tools for understanding and optimizing
your code.**

Profiling tools, like [pprof] and [perf], allow collecting performance
information over the entire execution of your program, and help create
visualizations for the performance of your program. RISC Zero has experimental
support for generating pprof files for cycle counts.

[Sampling CPU profilers], as implemented by pprof and perf, provide a view of
where your program is spending its time. It does so by recording the current
call stack at a sampling interval. RISC Zero provides a "sampling" [^1] CPU
profiler for guest execution.

One very useful visualization of this data is as a [flamegraph], such as the one
below for the [ECDSA verification example][example-ecdsa].

![ECDSA verification flamegraph][ecdsa-flamegraph]

Generate this profile and flamegraph by [installing Go][golang-install] and
running the following commands:

```bash
# In your clone of github.com/risc0/risc0
cd examples/ecdsa
RISC0_PPROF_OUT=ecdsa_verify.pb RISC0_DEV_MODE=true cargo run
go tool pprof -http 127.0.0.1:8000 ecdsa_verify.pb
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000/ui/flamegraph](http://127.0.0.1:8000/ui/flamegraph)
in your web browser to see the flamegraph.

Although it's bundled with Go, the `pprof` tool can be used with profiles from
programs not written in Golang. `pprof` has extensive functionality, and the
documentation linked below contains information about the different views
provided, comparing profiles, and much more.

Documentation for `pprof`: [github.com/google/pprof][pprof]

**More information about profiling can be found in the [Guest Profiling
Guide][profiling]**

## Key Differences

Using general purpose advice and tools for optimization will work 80% of the
time. But there are some key differences between how physical CPUs and the zkVM
operate that can be important to understand when trying to get the best possible
guest performance.

**This section explains some of the most important differences between a
physical CPU and the zkVM, as they relate to guest performance.**

### Most [RISC-V operations] take exactly one cycle

**Not all operations cost the same amount.** An `add` instruction takes fewer
cycles than a `div`. This is true for both the zkVM and physical CPUs.

However, the relative difference between instructions is much smaller in the
zkVM. In the zkVM, a `div` takes twice as long as an `add`. On a physical CPU, a
`div` takes [15-40 times][op-cycles] as long compared to an `add`. Practically,
this means if you have a choice between implementing an [algorithm] with 10
`add` ops, or a single `div`. On a physical CPU, choose the `add` ops. In the
zkVM choose the `div`.

- Addition, comparison, jump, shift left, load and store all take one cycle.
- Bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR), division, remainder, and shift right take
  two cycles.

Note that this means that shift left is no faster than multiplying by a power of
two, and shift right is no faster than division. A number of other small
optimizations like this, routinely applied by developers and compilers, have no
effect in the zkVM.

See the [table in the appendix][appendix] for more information about cycle
counts per operation.

### Memory Access Costs One Cycle, Except When It Doesn't

[RISC-V operations] require data to be loaded from memory to [registers] before
it can acted on (e.g. used as input to an `add`). It must also be written back
to memory to store the result. Memory loads and stores (i.e. reads and writes)
usually take one cycle.

Memory access, both load and store takes exactly one cycle, except in the case
of page-in and page-out operations ([discussed below](#paging)).

Note that relative to a physical CPU, this is extremely fast (in terms of
cycles). On a physical CPU even a value in [L1 cache] takes [3-4
cycles][op-cycles] to access. L3 cache takes [30-70 cycles][op-cycles] and main
memory [100-150][op-cycles]. One of the most common bottlenecks in applications
is the round-trip time it takes to access a data in memory.

#### Paging

Every execution of the zkVM starts from an initial memory state. This memory
state (a.k.a. image) is referenced by an [image ID], which contains a [Merkle
root] committing to all data in memory. For efficiency, data in memory is split
into 1 kB pages.

Pages in the zkVM are analogous a [page in an operating system][os-page], and in
particular this term was chosen in reference to [memory paging], or swapping,
systems. Execution of a program is split into [continuation segments]. Between
segments, the zkVM essentially [hibernates], saving all working memory to the
host; as a CPU would use a hard drive.

The first time a page is accessed in a segment, it needs to be **paged-in**,
loading it from the host. Confirming the page is correct, the guest verifies a
Merkle inclusion proof for the page against the image ID. Note as well that the
address of the program counter must be paged-in, as instructions are loaded
from memory. These hashing operations required take a number of cycles.

In order to support continuation after the segment ends (i.e. the zkVM
"hibernates"), it needs to **page-out** pages that were modified. Paging-out
takes the same number of operations as paging-in, so for the first time any
given page is written to in a segment, it is marked as "dirty". At the end
of segment execution, every dirty page must be "paged-out" at a cost of 1094 to
5130 cycles. An exception to this rule is the last segment, where no paging out
occurs, since there will be no continuation from the last segment.

**A page-in or page-out operation takes between 1094 and 5130 cycles; 1130
cycles on average.**

The very first page-in or page-out takes longer, 5130 cycles, because it needs
to traverse up the page table (i.e. Merkle tree) all the way to the root, which
is equal to the image ID. Once a path is verified, it doesn't need to be hashed
again, so most page-in operations only need to hash the leaf (i.e. data) page.
If a program were to iterate over memory in sequence, it would cost on average
1130 cycles per page, or 1.35 cycles per byte.

If, after profiling your application, you learn page-in and page-out operations
are a significant overhead, you can optimize your application by reducing it's
memory usage and locality. This will be somewhat similar to optimizing for data
locality and L1/2 cache usage. Using fewer pages, using the same page repeatedly
instead of a random access pattern, and condensing the range of addresses
accessed can all help reduce paging overhead. It's best to experiment.

### The Zkvm Does Not Have Native Floating Point Operations

The RISC Zero zkVM does not implement the RISC-V floating point instructions. As
a result, all floating point operations are emulated in software. In contrast to
integer operations that take 1-2 cycles, floating point operations can take
60-140 cycles for basic operations such as add, subtract, multiply, and divide.

**When possible, use integers instead of floating point numbers.**

### Unaligned Data Access Is Significantly More Expensive

CPUs define a standard size of data for operation; and this is referred to as a
word. In RISC-V 32-bit ISA, the size of a word is 32 bits (4 bytes). Memory is
always read and stored as words.

When the read or store address is not a multiple of 4 bytes, the operation is
much more expensive. In a simple benchmark, reading an unaligned `u32` value
costs 12 cycles, versus 1 cycle for an aligned read.

All allocations will be aligned by default, and the compiler wants to help you,
so this should usually not be an issue.

If you are defining structs that containing small primitive typed fields (e.g.
`bool`, `u8`, `i16`) and access this data very frequently, you might consider
paying extra care to the [alignment of those fields][alignment]. Additionally,
if you are slicing into byte arrays, try to do so at word-aligned indices.

### When Reading Data as Raw Bytes, Use `env::read_slice`

When reading input into the guest, [`env::read`] is the main API to use. It
automatically deserializes the input bytes into structs, like in this [snippet
from the password checker example][snippet-password-checker].

```rust no_run
# use risc0_zkvm::guest::env;
# use serde::Deserialize;
# #[derive(Deserialize)]
# struct PasswordRequest;
let request: PasswordRequest = env::read();
```

In the host code, `ExecutorEnvBuilder::write` function is used to serialize and
write to input struct so that the guest can read it.

```rust
# use risc0_zkvm::ExecutorEnv;
# use serde::Serialize;
# #[derive(Serialize)]
# struct PasswordRequest {};
let request = PasswordRequest { /* .. */ };
let env = ExecutorEnv::builder()
        .write(&request).unwrap()
        .build()
        .unwrap();
```

In most cases, these APIs are what you should use to send data to the guest.

However, when you need to read and work with data as raw bytes (or words), it is
more efficient to use [`env::read_slice`] or `env::stdin().read_to_end`. Both
methods do no (de)serialization and so do not need to copy or reinterpret the
input data. Examples of when this may be useful are if you are reading in image
data as bytes, or reading data that is binary encoded from the source like with
[CBOR].

Here is a [snippet from the Bonsai Governance
example][snippet-bonsai-governance] showing how to read bytes.

```rust no_run
# use std::io::Read;
# use risc0_zkvm::guest::env;
let mut input_bytes = Vec::<u8>::new();
env::stdin().read_to_end(&mut input_bytes).unwrap();
```

On the host side, `ExecutorEnvBuilder::write_slice` is used to pass in the bytes.

```rust
# use risc0_zkvm::ExecutorEnv;
let input_bytes: Vec<u8> = b"INPUT DATA".to_vec();
let env = ExecutorEnv::builder()
        .write_slice(&input_bytes)
        .build()
        .unwrap();
```

### When You Only Need Part of the Input Data, Try Merklizing It

Some programs only need part of the whole available data. [Where's
Waldo][example-waldo] is an example of this. The full input is an image, but
only the part with Waldo in it is needed. Loading and hashing the whole image
would be quite expensive, so instead the initial input for the guest is just the
Merkle root and each chunk is loaded dynamically. The guest verifies that the
chunk is indeed part of the image by verifying the Merkle inclusion proof.

If you are writing a guest with a large input, and only part of it is needed for
the computation, consider splitting it into some notion of a chunks and building
it as a Merkle tree. You can use the [code for Where's Waldo][waldo-merkle] as a
starting point.

### Cryptography in the Guest Can Utilize Accelerator Circuits

RISC Zero's riscv32im implementation includes a number of special purpose
operations, including two "accelerators" for cryptographic functions: SHA-256
and [256-bit modular multiplication][bigint]. By implementing these operations
directly in the "hardware" of the zkVM, programs that use these accelerators
execute faster and can be proven with significantly less resources [^2].

For more information about cryptography precompiles, [cryptography
precompiles][precompiles].

Using the accelerator, a SHA-256 compress operation typically takes 68 cycles
per 64-byte block and 6 cycles to initialize. A 256-bit modular multiply takes
10 cycles. This includes basic memory operation cycles, but does not include
page-in or page-out operations that are triggered.

### Memory Access Is Synchronous

On a physical CPU, memory access is asynchronous to register operations; meaning
arithmetic or logic operations on registers can run while the CPU is waiting for
the result from memory. Because the memory fetch latency is quite large
(100-150x the time to `add` two registers), this gives rise to techniques such
as prefetching and speculative execution, implemented both at the processor and
application levels.

In the zkVM, all memory operations are synchronous, regardless of if the data is
currently paged-in. **Memory prefetching does not help (but can hurt) zkVM guest
performance.**

### All Execution Is Single-Threaded

The zkVM has one core and one thread of execution. As a result, there is no need
or use for multi-threading. **Using `async` routines, locking, or atomic
operations in the guest can only slow the program down.**

### The zkVM has no pipelining or other instruction-level parallelism.

Modern processors have execution pipelines and [superscalar
architectures][superscalar] designed to [execute instructions in parallel][ilp].
Instruction throughput is much higher when the pipeline is kept full and
independent execution units are utilized. CPUs implement out-of-order and
speculative execution, among other techniques to achieve this.

By comparison, RISC Zero's riscv32im implementation is very simple. Instructions
will be read from the guest program and executed in the order chosen by the
compiler.

Developers and compilers often use techniques such as pre-fetching, avoiding
branches, or reordering instructions to maximize instruction-level parallelism.
**These techniques have essentially no effect in the zkVM.**

## Prover Acceleration

You are probably interested in guest optimization in order to have faster
proving times, to reduce compute costs, or both. RISC Zero can leverage hardware
accelerators, the ones made of real silicon this time, to accomplish both of
these objectives.

With an NVIDIA graphics card, proving can be accelerated through the [CUDA]
implementation. When running a zkVM application, a compatible version of the
CUDA runtime needs to be installed. When building the zkVM from source, a
compatible version of the CUDA toolkit needs to be installed on the build
machine, and the `cuda` feature enabled.

## TL;DR and Quick Wins

- [Profile your applications][profiling] to find where cycles are being spent.
- Try different [compiler settings][profiles]
  - Setting `lto = "thin"` is sometimes faster than `lto = "fat"` or `lto = true`.
  - Sometimes `opt-level = 2` is faster than `3`. Try `s` and `z` too.
  - Try setting `codegen-units = 1`.
- When you need a map, use `BTreeMap` instead of `HashMap`.
- When you need to hash data, use the [precompile implementation of
  SHA-256][precompiles].
- Look for places where you are copying or (de)serializing data when not
  necessary.

### RISC Zero ECALL Operations

RISC-V specifies a mechanism for environment calls (ecalls), which may be
specified by the vendor. In RISC Zero's zkVM, ecalls are specified for a number
of core operations. A short description and associated cycle counts are listed
below.

| Selector | Description                | Operations                                                                                                                       | Cycles                  |
| -------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| HALT     | Halt execution             | Set system exit code to a0. Load 32-bytes output digest from \[a1]. Set output digest global. Halt execution.                    | 1 + paging              |
| SOFTWARE | Receive data from the host | Write host-provided data to the memory range \[a0 .. a0 + a1 \* 4]                                                               | 1 + ⌈ a1 / 4 ⌉ + paging |
| SHA-256  | SHA-256 hash               | Compute the Merkle–Damgård compression of the region \[a2 .. a2 + a3 \* 64] with initial state \[a1]. Write the digest to \[a0]. | 6 + 68 \* a2 + paging   |
| BIGINT   | 256-bit modular operation  | if a1 = 0, \[a0] ← \[a2] ⋅ \[a3] (mod \[a4])                                                                                     | 10 + paging             |

[^1]: Here "sampling" is in quotes because the profiler actually captures the call
    stack at every cycle of program execution. Capturing a call stack on every
    cycle of execution is not done in most programs on physical CPUs for a few
    reasons:

    1. It would be cost prohibitive to do so for all but quite short program
       executions.
    2. Introducing such heavy profiling would actually alter the performance
       characteristics in significant ways.

    In zkVM execution, executions are generally short and all execution is
    synchronous and is not subject to any deviations in behavior due to
    measurement overhead.

[^2]: This is similar to the cryptography support such as [AES-NI] or the [SHA
    extensions] for x86 processors. In both cases, the circuitry is extended to
    compute otherwise expensive operations in fewer instruction cycles.
