# Guest Profiling Guide

In this guide, we'll explore how to effectively profile guest code within the
RISC Zero zkVM, offering insights and tools to improve performance.

We'll be using a guest program with three different implementations of the
Fibonacci sequence calculation to provide a base profile to explore. You can
find all the code used as example in the [profiling example][example-profiling].

## Background

Profiling tools, like [pprof] and [perf], allow collecting performance
information over the entire execution of your program, and help create
visualizations for the performance of your program. RISC Zero has experimental
support for generating pprof files for cycle counts.

[Sampling CPU profilers][profiler], as implemented by pprof and perf, provide a
view of where your program is spending its time. It does so by recording the
current call stack at a sampling interval. RISC Zero provides a "sampling" [^1]
CPU profiler for guest execution.

## Usage

### Step 1: Prerequisites

First, follow the [installation guide][install] if you don't already have the
RISC Zero tools installed.

Additionally, you will need to [install Go][golang-install], which bundles with
it the [pprof] tool.

### Step 2: Running

Run the Fibonacci profiling example with:

```bash
RISC0_PPROF_OUT=./profile.pb RUST_LOG=info RISC0_DEV_MODE=1 RISC0_INFO=1 cargo run
```

The above command will run the Fibonacci computation for 1000 iterations and
write the profiling output to `profile.pb`. Use the environment variable
`RISC0_PPROF_OUT` to set to the desired output path for the profiling data.
We recommend running profiling in [dev mode][devmode] to avoid unnecessary proving time.

### Step 3: Visualization

To visualize the profile using `pprof`, run:

```bash
go tool pprof -http=127.0.0.1:8000 profile.pb
```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

You can find much more information about how to use `pprof` in the [official
pprof documentation][pprof].

## Exploring the Example Profile

There are three different Fibonacci sequence calculation methods provided in the
[profiling example][example-profiling]:

1. `fibonacci_1`: A basic iterative method.
2. `fibonacci_2`: An optimized iterative method that attempts to batch
   computation.
3. `fibonacci_3`: A matrix exponentiation approach, which is a fast method to
   compute Fibonacci numbers.

The guest code reads the number of iterations from the host, computes the
Fibonacci number using all the above methods, and finally commits the answer
back to the host.

Below is the example [flamegraph] you will see by opening
[http://localhost:8000/ui/flamegraph](http://localhost:8000/ui/flamegraph),
after running the [steps above](#usage).

When you visualize the profiling data, you can see the relative performance in
terms of [cycle count] of the three Fibonacci implementations. This can be
helpful in understanding the efficiency of various algorithms and their
performance implications.

Use the pprof web interface to compare the performance of the 3 Fibonacci
implementations. Refer to the [pprof docs][pprof] for more information about the
web interface.

## Inline Functions

Your compiler may end up inlining a lot of functions which can make it difficult to see what is
going on in the profile sometimes. If you have compiled your program with debug symbols you can
enable inline function tracking in the profiler by setting
`RISC0_PPROF_ENABLE_INLINE_FUNCTIONS=yes`. This will make the profile more detailed, but it comes at
a cost of slowing down the profiler.

[^1]: Here "sampling" is in quotes because the profiler actually captures the call
    stack at every cycle of program execution. Capturing a call stack on every
    cycle of execution is not done in most programs on physical CPUs for a few
    reasons:

    1. It would be cost prohibitive to do so for all but quite short program
       executions.
    2. Introducing such heavy profiling would actually alter the performance
       characteristics in significant ways.

    In zkVM execution, executions are generally short and all execution is
    synchronous and is not subject to any deviations in behavior due to
    measurement overhead.
