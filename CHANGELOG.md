# CHANGELOG

## Next (upcoming release)

TBD

## [v1.0.5 (2024-07-30)](https://github.com/risc0/risc0/releases/tag/v1.0.5)

### 🛠 Fixes

* Change the host to validate the guest buffer address if its length is non-zero. This fixes an issue that occurs when building the guest with Rust toolchain version 1.79.0.

## [v1.0.4 (2024-07-26)](https://github.com/risc0/risc0/releases/tag/v1.0.4)

### 🛠 Fixes

* Apply a workaround for LLVM compiler bug for rv32im to ensure that lower bits of addresses are preserved.
* Fix panic by remove page_size parameter from serialized MemoryImage

## [v1.0.3 (2024-07-16)](https://github.com/risc0/risc0/releases/tag/v1.0.3)

### 🛠 Fixes

* Fix client/server version compatibility.

## [v1.0.2 (2024-07-11)](https://github.com/risc0/risc0/releases/tag/v1.0.2)

### ⚡️ Features
* Improve executor performance by 2x.
* `bonsai-sdk`: enable execute-only mode. This will run the guest program but will not produce a receipt. This can be used to quickly measure the complexity of the guest program.
* `bonsai-sdk`: simplify the SDK by using the `maybe_async` crate.

### 🛠 Fixes

* Fix `no_std` starter template.
* Fix serialization of structs such as `NaiveDate` which calls into `collect_str`.

## [v1.0.1 (2024-06-04)](https://github.com/risc0/risc0/releases/tag/v1.0.1)

### 🛠 Fixes

* Fix issue with building CUDA kernels.

## [v1.0.0 (2024-06-04)](https://github.com/risc0/risc0/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

### 🔥 Prover Performance Improvements

* Witness generation has been parallelized by adding another preflight pass.
* Improved performance by minimizing data transfers when constructing merkle proofs.
* Parallelized `step_verify_bytes` function.
* Changed `eval_check` to use precomputed powers for poly_mix.

### 🛠 Fixes

* Fixed a bug with an unaligned short read.
* Commit globals in Fiat-Shamir transcript.
* Fixed an undefined behavior warning generated by rust 1.77.2 in guest.
* Addressed security vulnerabilities in the rv32im circuit.
* Fix clippy warnings in all published crates.
* Fix build issues arising from an undefined `_end` symbol.

### ⚡️ Features

* Generalized proof composition.
* Benchmarks have been improved.
* A new web app that can be used to display datasheets, prover benchmarks, application benchmarks and supported crates.
* Added the ability to compile Rust crates that bind to C code.
* Added a new `cargo risczero deploy` command to deploy ELF binaries to bonsai.
* `ProverOpts` now has a new `ReceiptKind` field. This is used to select the
minimum compression level of receipt to be generated by the `Prover` and
`ProverServer` traits. The kinds include composite (a receipt containing a
vector of segment receipts), succinct (a receipt where all segments have been
compressed into a single receipt via the lift and join recursion programs),
and compact (a snark receipt generated by compressing a succinct receipt using
a groth16 prover. This used for on-chain proving).
* A `compress` function has been added to the `Prover` trait. This allows the users to more easily change receipts to a different kind in the host.
* Rust's `alloc_zeroed` function has been optimized in the guest.
* Export `NullSegmentRef` for use by host code.
* Added a soundness error calculator.
* Bonsai SDK: added a method used to download receipts.
* Bonsai SDK: improved error messages.
* Bonsai SDK: added a new API to stop a proving session in Bonsai.

### 🚨 Breaking Changes

* Change sys_cycle_count to return a `u64` instead of u32.

* The `Prover` trait's `prove()` function now returns a `ProveInfo`. This `struct`
  contains the receipt as well as cycle and segment information gathered during
  the proof generation. The following is the definition of `ProveInfo` and
  `SessionStats` structs:

```rust
/// Information returned by the prover including receipt as well as other information useful for debugging
pub struct ProveInfo {
    /// receipt from the computation
    pub receipt: Receipt,
    /// stats about cycle counts of the execution
    pub stats: SessionStats,
}

/// Struct containing information about a prover's cycle count after running the guest program
pub struct SessionStats {
    /// Count of segments in this proof request
    pub segments: usize,
    /// Total cycles run within guest
    pub total_cycles: u64,
    /// User cycles run within guest
    pub user_cycles: u64,
}

```
For those upgrading from v0.21.0, the following code change is necessary on the host side to retrieve the receipt.

```diff
-   let receipt = prover.prove(env, BEVY_GUEST_ELF).unwrap();
+   let receipt = prover.prove(env, BEVY_GUEST_ELF).unwrap().receipt;
```

## [v0.21.0 (2024-03-11)](https://github.com/risc0/risc0/releases/tag/v0.21.0)

### 🛠 Fixes

* Fix an issue where the temporary directory is not being removed when the
`Session` goes out of scope. This helps prevent the depletion of disk space.

* Verification of groth16 receipts in rust that are compatible with Bonsai

### ⚡️ Features

* Add an improved Poseidon2 hashing function that replaces Poseidon for recursive proofs.

### 🚨 Breaking Changes

* For recursive proofs, the Poseidon hash function is replaced by the Poseidon2 hash function. Users can still create receipts using the older Poseidon hash function but these receipts will not be usable by Bonsai or any proof composition or rollup use cases.

## [v0.20.1 (2024-02-01)](https://github.com/risc0/risc0/releases/tag/v0.20.1)

### 🛠 Fixes

* Revert change to `Prover::prove` to return a `SuccinctReceipt`. This prevents
  a performance regression for default use cases.

## [v0.20.0 (2024-01-29)](https://github.com/risc0/risc0/releases/tag/v0.20.0)

### 🛠 Fixes

* Restrict software ecall handler address range
* Fix argument handling in client/server mode
* Change jal to call in zkVM entrypoint #1257
* Improve ZKR zip file handling

### ⚡️ Features

* Support for [Proof Composition](https://dev.risczero.com/terminology#composition)
* Add execution statistics when using `RUST_LOG=info`
* Add XGBoost example using Spice AI query to train a model
* Improve CUDA performance by integrating [sppark](https://github.com/supranational/sppark/)
* Add Poseidon2 support to CUDA backend
* Support for verifying Groth16 proofs
* Add exponential backoff to bonsai proof polling
* add `getrandom` feature to toggle getrandom in the guest
* Adjust `Prover::prove` to return a `SuccinctReceipt` by default

### 🚨 Breaking Changes

* Rename `ReceiptMetadata` to `ReceiptClaim`
* Drop `MemoryImage` from the public API
* Drop _elf suffix from API. For example, `Prover::prove_elf` is renamed `Prover::prove`.
